DNS - Domain Name Servers are internet's equivalent of a phone book. They maintain a directory of domain names and translate them to IP addressses.
When you type in a web address, e.g., www.jimsbikes.com, your Internet Service Provider views the DNS associated with the domain name, translates it into a machine friendly IP address (for example 216.168.224.70 is the IP for jimsbikes.com) and directs your Internet connection to the correct website.
